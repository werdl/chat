Welcome to my conversational chatbot! Ask it some questions.
Note: It is not designed to operate like GPT-3, rather to talk with you.
Try asking 'how are you'.
Type 'sentiment' to perform sentiment analysis.

If it doesn't recognise your input, it will return the top Google search response if it is a question
Or else say some ambiguous phrases

Also please bear in bind the search is unreliable at best (dodgy dependancy)
